" MaxSteps\n"
"\n"
" Maximum number of times the die will move per roll. \n"
" The bigger this value is, the longer it takes for the\n"

"\n"
" A complete rolling-animation will consume this many \n"
" Steps, something like Frames if it was implemented\n"
" as a true animation, but it is not.\n"
"\n"
" Thus, if the specified MaxSteps are more than 32\n"
" for the 3D effect or more than 6 for the 2D effect\n"
" (that's how many image-files it takes to implement\n"
" each of those effects) then the animation changes\n"
" direction.\n"
"\n"
" If the specified MaxSteps are less the than those\n"
" limits, the animation simply stops prematurely."
